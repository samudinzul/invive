1.<b>Am I signing over the rights to my music, home and firstborn?</b> No. The only rights we take are the obvious ones we need to run the service. For example, the right to host the music you upload, stream and sell it on your behalf, display whatever artwork you put on the site, and so on. 
        <br>
2.<b>What can I upload? Are covers OK?</b> You must own or control all rights to everything you upload. That means covers are out, unless you have a written license or authorization from the artist to upload the cover to INVIVE and grant us the rights in the terms below. Do not upload cover songs unless you have obtained all permissions and authorizations in writing! These requirements apply regardless of whether you're selling the music or giving it away.
